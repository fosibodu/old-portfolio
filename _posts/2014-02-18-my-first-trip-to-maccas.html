<p>Although the sign may say McDonald's, no one in Australia uses the word. It is called <strong>Macca's</strong>. I was immediately laughed at when I asked where the nearest McDonald's was; I'm never making that mistake again.</p>

<p>At about 8:30 this morning I woke up Matt, another American exchange student, and we walked about ten minutes to Kingsford. The first thing I noticed was the small cafe inside which sold pastries and macaroons; I never knew McDonald's could be so high end.</p>

<p>I ordered a bacon and egg McMuffin without the eggs (they don't sell bagels!). After receiving my food and sitting down, I took a bite into the sandwich and became instantly disappointed. The bacon had a familiar taste, but it was definitely not bacon. It was ham.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of ham.</p>
<p>Straya has disappointed me.</p>
