<p>If Adobe Illustrator has taught me anything, it's patience.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Over winter break, I've been able to take a break from school and work and just enjoy my free time. I spent most of that time reading, listening to the Serial podcast and playing around on Photoshop and Illustrator. I don't look for a lot of inspiration online, even though I probably should, but when I see something I like, I bookmark it. I've been spending a lot of time on Dribbble, a website which designers upload their work for anyone to see and I've pretty much like everything I saw. The work made me want to do stuff like that, to illustrate. So I did.</p>
<p>It's easier for me to work off things I know; and I know nothing better than my iPad Mini and my iPhone 5s, so I decided to work with those. I will be designing as much as I can because it's a challenge that I would like to keep up with, so I can be as good and precise as possible.</p>
