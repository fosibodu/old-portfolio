<p>Two days after I arrived in Sydney, at the last minute, I decided to road trip with eleven other exchange students to Melbourne. I didn't want to go at first because it seemed like the plans weren't concrete, but then I figured I will only be in Australia once so why not?</p>

<p>With twelve of us, there was bound to be many different backgrounds: Nida from Thailand, Carlos, Clara and Micha from Spain, Evelien and Sjoerd from the Netherlands, Sophie from Korea, Matt, Michael, Jacob, Cambridge and I from the United States.</p>
<p>I put off writing this blog post for a while, so I've pretty much forgotten a lot of the stuff we did. We made it all the way down to Lakes Entrance in the state of Victoria, then we decided to visit the Australian capital of Canberra before we headed home. Below is a screenshot of a map of the route we took, excluding Canberra and the ride back to Kensington.</p>

<p>Some of the places we visited include Jervis Bay, Croajingolong National Park (Thurra River, Point Hicks Lighthouse, sand dunes), and the Ninety Mile Beach.</p>
