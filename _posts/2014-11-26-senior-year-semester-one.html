<p>I've probably mentioned it before, but I am a terrible blogger. An entire semester has passed by since my last post. Well if you'd like to know how my senior year is going, I'm approaching the final stretch (May 17th couldn't come soon enough).</p>

<p>I've been spending most of my time in The Daily Ilini's newsroom as I took over as Photo Editor from my friend <a href="http://www.brentontsephotography.com">Brenton</a> when I came back from Australia. It's definitely been an experience that has given me more opportunities than I can count. I owe it to the DI for my love of sports photography and the chance to cover Big Ten football and basketball, which is why I'm hoping for an Illini football win at Northwestern this weekend because that means our sixth win and a bowl game.</p>
<p>It's internship season, so on top of my editorial duties and schoolwork, I've been applying for photojournalist internships across the country at different papers such as The Seattle Times, The Oregonian and Houston Chronicle. Aside from photography, I have a huge interest in design, web design specifically, so I've also been applying for front end developing internships wherever I can find them (if you see any, send them my way!).</p>
<p>Not very good at bringing things to an end, so here's a picture of a sailboat I'm designing for an assignment. Oh, and Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
