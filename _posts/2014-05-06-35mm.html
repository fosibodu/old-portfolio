<p>I haven't updated my blog in two months, sorry.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I should probably have written about my Blue Mountains trip in March (it's still a draft) and my mid semester break trip to Melbourne and Tasmania which happened two weeks ago, but I'll save those for a day when I'm up for it. I sort of recently bought a new camera, because two obviously isn't enough. I decided to invest in an analog camera. I was given a project to do in my Photogram to Instagram class which required the use of 35mm film photography, which I had no clue about.  I found out it is essentially the same thing as shooting with my DSLR in manual mode, all I had to do was learn to load a roll of film.  I picked up my Nikon FM10 from a store in Newton called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/smilepleasesydneysuper8mm">Smile Please</a> which specializes in analog and vintage cameras.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I started out shooting with black and white film (Kodak Tri-X 400) because that was what was required for class. Also, the College of Fine Arts has resources for developing your own B&amp;W film which was very exciting because the digital process is not this extensive. Yesterday, I finally learned how to scan film with a flatbed (Epson V700), although I still need to learn to use a real film scanner such as the Hasselblads the school offers. These are some of my first scans:</p>
