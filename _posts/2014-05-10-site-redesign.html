<p>I designed my current website sometime last fall or winter—can't exactly remember when—but anyway, I think it's time for a new design. <!--more--> What I'm currently working on will resemble what I have now, but will be even <del>simpler</del> cleaner? I would like to use some of the things I've learned at my internship at <a href="http://www.wiliam.com.au" target="_blank">Wiliam</a> about design and put my knowledge to use. I know a responsive website is in order, and I plan on doing that this time. Also a revamp of my blog and still learning to work Wordpress themes as well as PHP.  I have been focusing more on design than photography lately, but hopefully I will have new photos coming up soon!</p>
<p>Here's a design I'm currently working on:</p>
<p><center><img class="size-large wp-image-95 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2014-05-11-at-1.49.16-PM-800x500.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-05-11 at 1.49.16 PM" width="800" height="500" /></center></p>
