<p>I was given the chance to put my design "skills" to the test when I volunteered myself to create The Daily Illini's Holiday Guide cover.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><a href="http://annahecht.com/">Anna</a>, our Creative Director, put a lot of faith in me when I said I would design. It didn't help that this guide landed at the end of the fall semester and right before finals week. I had help from my two favorite graphic designers <a href="http://scottdurand.com/">Scott</a> and Bryan (he gave lots of necessary criticisms). The pattern was the most frustrating because it had to be symmetrical, in other words, perfect. I'm not officially calling myself a graphic designer just yet, I believe I still have a ways to go. Overall, I'm happy with what I've done.</p>
