<p>If you're up to date on your current events, then you probably know what's going on in Western AsiaÂ between Israel and the Palestinian region known as Gaza. If not, read <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/israel-gaza-conflict/story?id=24552237">here</a>.</p>

<p>Today I was downtown Chicago covering Big Ten Media Days for the upcoming football season. I was also trying to get license plates, but that's another story entirely. I was walking to the DMV when I came upon the intersection of Clark and Randolph and there were Israeli and Palestinian flags at the four corners. It happened to be my lucky day because I had my gear for once.</p>
