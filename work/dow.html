        <p>I currently work as a User Interface Designer on multiple projects to be used in different departments. I design web applications by creating wireframes in Adobe Photoshop and writing user stories. I also develop the user interface of single page web apps using Durandal and KnockoutJS as well as JayData to manage tables from databases. </p>
