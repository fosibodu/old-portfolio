        <p>Currently a side project in progress, I am developing a concept mobile app of <a href="http://www.way-bag.com/">Way Bag</a>, a product created by <a href="http://www.euniekim.com/">Eunie Kim</a> for her senior design thesis. I did some product photography for her project which she used in her website.</p>
        <p>As a twenty-something growing up in the digital age with smartphones, I have noticed that we as a society have shifted from shopping in stores to the web and now on our mobile phones and tablets. I want to create a functional and effective application which would bring ease to online shopping without the frustration that users tend to feel.</p>
        <p>I am currently working through wireframes in Sketch and prototyping in Origami.</p>
