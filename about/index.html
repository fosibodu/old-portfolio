        <p><b>I'm Folake</b>
            <br>I am interested in all aspects of design, with a focus on user interfaces. I try to keep up to seped with the ever changing research and technologies of web design.</p>
        <p> I recently graduated from the University of Illinois with a major in Photography. I currently work as a User Interface Designer at the <a href="http://www.dow.com/">Dow Chemical Company</a>.</p>
        <p>When I'm not designing at work, I'm designing at home. I also play around with 2D animation in After Effects and attempt my New Year's resolution of reading more (Currently reading: Don't Make Me Think, Revisited by Steve Krug). </p>
